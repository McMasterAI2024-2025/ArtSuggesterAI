## :wrench: Model Architecture & Training the Model
The project uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) built with TensorFlow to classify art mediums. The model was trained using images from various online databases consisting of paintings and drawings across different mediums such as paint, pencil crayons, and markers.

## :mag: Data Collection
The datasets used for training the model were collected from publicly available online databases featuring artwork in different mediums. This diverse dataset ensures the model can effectively identify and classify various artistic styles and tools.

## :cloud: Hosting & Deployment
The database and user information, including favorited images, are hosted using MongoDB for efficient storage and retrieval.

## :link: Colab Notebooks
Colab notebooks used to create the models can be found in the backend folder of the projectâ€™s GitHub repository.
